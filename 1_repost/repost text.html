    <p>Praised for its revolutionary technique and studied for its perplexing imagery,
Jan van Eyck’s Arnolfni Portrait has remained a riddle since the 19th century.
Completed in 1434 in Bruges, the work showcases a skilled use of oil paints
and impressively realistic details. More famous and perhaps more important,
however, than van Eyck’s technique are the two fgures and the objects which
decorate their setting. These elements together are the subject of many ongoing
debates. These debates focused specifcally on the identity of the fgures,
their gestures, and the overall meaning of the work.
</p>

<p>The painting portrays a man and a woman linking hands. Lavishly dressed, the
fgures stand in a grand bedchamber. The male fgure, on the left of the composition,
raises his right hand. To the right, the female fgure uses her left hand to
lift the folds of her green dress. A small dog stands at the couple’s feet. Two
pairs of shoes lie discarded around the room. In addition, several pieces of fruit
lie on a ledge beneath the window to the left. An ornate, golden chandelier hangs
just above the couple’s heads. It holds a single, burning candle over the male
fgure’s head. Appearing along the far wall is a line of swirling text, which,
translated from Latin, reads, “Jan van Eyck was here.” Underneath this signature
is a circular mirror holding the refection of two fgures in red and blue turbans.
The mirror is surrounded with small images of the Passion of Christ. A wooden
fgurine of St. Margaret stands atop a wardrobe, just to the left of the female
fgure’s head. A gargoyle, another wooden fgure, is meant to accompany the image of St. Margaret, sitting above the couple’s handclasp. Describing the texture
and lighting of the painting, Panofsky notes, “these statuesque fgures are
placed in an interior sufused with a dim though colored light, which shows
up the peculiar tactual values of such materials as brass, velvet, wood and fur,
so that they appear interwoven with each other within a homogeneous chiaroscuro
atmosphere”. </p>

<p>Arnolfni was not in Bruges until after van Eyck’s portrait was completed, nor
was he frst married until 1447. Therefore, it would have been impossible for
van Eyck to portray Giovanni Arnolfni and Jeanne Cenami in the portrait. Further
research acknowledges the fgures as Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfni and
Constanza, a couple who lived in Bruges and wed there in 1426 (Graham 197).
The couples’ gestures, which seem to be at the root of nearly every theory
regarding the portrait, are even more important in understanding the meaning
of the Arnolfni Portrait. Van Eyck depicts Giovanni raising his right hand
and using his left to hold Constanza’s right hand. Particularly fascinated with
Giovanni’s oath-like gesture, Panofsky celebrated “the confdent humility” and
“the amount of tender personal feeling with which the artist has invested the
conventional gesture.” </p>

<p>Though it is not certain what scene van Eyck is depicting, the fgures’ gestures
are most commonly associated with that of a wedding ceremony. Bedaux explains
that, “in several dioceses in Belgium and the north of France in the late
middle ages, the couple gave themselves to each other by joining hands and,
raising the other hand, making a gesture reminiscent of an oath” (7). Similarly,
Panofsky remarks that gestures and afrming words were required to certify a
marital union (123). “In art, the words could not be heard,” Sandler concludes,
“only the handclasp could be shown, so it became the chief visual evidence of
marriage” (480). Hall, on the other hand, suggests that the handclasp is not one
of a marriage ceremony, but rather a betrothal. In this case, the couple can be
seen pledging their faithfulness to their engagement in a ceremony that, in the
14th century, was comparable to a marriage known for causing “quite a stir in art-historical literature” is the manner by
which Giovanni joins his left hand with Constanza’s right hand.
 </p>

 <p> As previously noted, Schabacker attempted to justify the unorthodox gesture by
suggesting it as a representation of a morganatic marriage. Recent research
by the National Gallery, however, disproved this theory. Regardless, the nature
of the handclasp remains a debated topic. Panofsky proposes that the only
reason the couple joins their hands left to right is to prevent a disturbance of
symmetry in the composition. Furthermore, Panofsky notes, “He endeavored to
avoid the overlapping of the right arm as well as the contraposto movement”
(125). Though it is likely van Eyck worked to create a successful composition,
Bedaux, among other critics, was not convinced by Panofsky’s claim. Instead,
he notes that in some marriages, “it was customary to lay the right hand of the
woman into the left hand of her spouse”. </p>

<p>Mystery has defned the Arnolfni Portrait since its debut, a result of the numerous
objects painted in van Eyck’s portrait. Of these objects, the refection of
two fgures in a mirror, the artist’s signature along the back wall, and the small
fgurines of St. Margaret and her monster are the most perplexing. Panofsky
remarks that the symbols “impress the beholder with a kind of mystery and
makes him inclined to suspect a hidden signifcance in all and every object”
(126). His suggestion of “hidden signifcance” has inspired tedious research by
art critics, resulting in the formation of numerous theories regarding the portrait’s
purpose (126).
Often called the Arnolfni Wedding, the portrait is most popularly believed to
portray a marriage. Supportive of this theory, Panofsky stated, “...Jan van Eyck’s...
portrait could not be described more briefy or more appropriately than by calling
it the representation of a...marital oath... by joining hands”. </p>

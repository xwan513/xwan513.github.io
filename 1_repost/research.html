  <h2>Text-Jan Van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait by Erwin Panofsky</h2>
    <img src="images/11.png">
        <p> Text is basically written around Arnolifini wedding portrait.
          Consider about the size of this painting, Jan van Eyck paid more attention to details, suggestive of his mastery of technique
        It mentioned a lot symbolic details about this painting. </p>

<h3>New online medium: VeeR camera</h3>

  <p>The Veer camera through 360 degree angle to show each painting as sort of photo uploaded on this app.
  It will automaticallt change the photo to a 360-degree visual style.
  My idea is to create an account named by Jan Van Eyck, and used this app to upload the recreated one drawing by me about his original one Arnolfini Portrait. So in this new world, people only need to through the veer camera can see the details of painting. Through a new way to show an different art world to people.  </p>

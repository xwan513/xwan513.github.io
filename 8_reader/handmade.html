          <p>
            The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines.
            The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.
          </p>

          <p>  I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software;
           web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations;
           web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of
           reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web.
              ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define the web of this period.
            In her essay, A Vernacular Web (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:</p>

            <blockquote>
              bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction.
              It was a web of sudden connections and personal links.
              Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer...
              it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines
              designed by usability experts.

            </blockquote>
            <p>For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research
              on the amateur web, see: One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent.
            </p>

            <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages
              and handmade print materials,such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.

            </p>

              I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for Fishes & Flying Things came
               from the material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an
               installation art exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small
                book-work which was meant to tell a circular story but when people got to the end they
                 stopped reading because that’s the way books work. In the web version, the last page linked
                 to the first; the story circled round and round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains.
                  Of the book-work, only one copy. The QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which
                   I still own, but the contents of which I can no longer access. The handmade website,
                   on the other hand, is still online and it still works.

            <p>
              The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic relationship.
              This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at Nottingham
              Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most influential
              online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a word-processed photocopied
              booklet which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly, trAce’s last
               output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:

            </p>

            <blockquote>
              The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain
               lively discussions about the use of mixed media in writing… The creative
               hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce Archive can easily be compared to
                the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF trAces: A Commemoration
                 of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce, page 14)


            </blockquote>

            <p>
            One of the many interesting things about the online archive of the trAce Online
             Writing Centre is how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination
              of its contents. Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts
              created elsewhere — manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs
               developed in a darkroom — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue
               to exist in the medium within which they were created. That said, the frames through which
               we view them continue to change. </p>

               <p>
               n "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
                Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play
                 broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object
                 anymore but actively generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing
                  old web pages in modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer
                  of dated web-design aesthetics overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions
                  beneath. Pages optimised for lower resolutions now take less than a third of the screen.
                  Ghosts of browsers past mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images.
                  Sound files play automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers
                   who are not us. </p>

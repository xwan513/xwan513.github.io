    <h2>By Terry Hemphill</h2>
    <h3><span class="image">Illustration</span> <img src="assets/image/g2.png" class="show"> is one of the most important forms of <span class="image">visual communication</span> <img src="assets/image/1.gif" class="show">: it informs and observes, delights and decorates, instructs and inspires. From the first drawings man made in a cave, illustration has played a fundamental role both in telling stories and in sharing information—and it is as relevant as ever in helping us understand our modern world. Today’s artists create an astonishing variety of illustrations across a spectrum of styles and genres, informed by a rich history and extraordinary innovations in recent decades. In this article, we’ll explore some of the art and social movements that have influenced illustration over the past 30 years.</h3>

  It’s impossible to talk about contemporary illustration without citing the influence of Push Pin Studios, founded in 1954 by Cooper Union classmates Seymour Chwast, Milton Glaser, and Edward Sorel. The artists at <span class="image">Push Pin </span> <img src="assets/image/pin.png" class="show">led a revolution. “Push Pin threw everything out the window in terms of referencing style,” says Whitney Sherman, director of the MFA in illustration practice at MICA. Working conceptually, Push Pin artists freely plundered art and graphic history—from fine art to <span class="image">comic books</span> <img src="assets/image/comic.gif" class="show">—and reimagined and recombined these diverse forms, creating innovative, delightful, unexpected work.</p>
  <p>By the late 1980s, <span class="image">illustrators</span> <img src="assets/image/drawing.gif" class="show"> were free to combine, experiment with, and celebrate different historical styles and methods. They were just as inspired by historical art movements as they were by the <span class="image">punk</span> <img src="assets/image/punk.gif" class="show"> culture of the 1970s and the era’s <span class="image">New York City</span> <img src="assets/image/newyork.gif" class="show">         street art scene. Graphic design also helped define the look of the decade, with publications like The Face, art-directed by Neville Brody, leading the way with its radical use of typography and layout, which inspired many illustrators and designers.

  <p>
    An international design movement that started in England in the 1890s and thrived for the next two decades, <span class="image">Art Nouveau</span> <img src="assets/image/art.jpg" class="show"> rebelled against the historical styles that had dominated design for most of the 19th century. Art Nouveau, just as its name implies, focused on innovation, and it led a revolution in modern design.

    Influenced by the British <span class="image">Arts and Crafts</span> <img src="assets/image/craft.gif" class="show"> movement, <span class="image">Japanese</span> <img src="assets/image/japan.gif" class="show"> design and woodblock prints, Celtic patterns and illuminated manuscripts, and the paintings of Van Gogh and Cezanne, and borrowing from Rococo style, the movement quickly spread across Europe.

    Distinct styles emerged in each country, but a common graphic language connected them all: free-flowing organic forms, botanical shapes, fluid lines, unique display <span class="image">typography</span> <img src="assets/image/look.gif" class="show"> and lettering, and attention to fine workmanship.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/image/IMAGE4.jpg" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">Fast forward to 2017, and the idea of an art movement is laughable. Everything from Stone Age cave paintings to the latest Postmodernist art has been tossed into the spin cycle of popular culture and consumerism. The first picture was uploaded to the Internet in 1992. Today, more than 80 million images are uploaded to Instagram alone each day. “There’s no more ‘flavor of the month,’” says designer and illustrator Von Glitschka, referring to a term he and another illustrator coined for work that would be popular with creative directors for a while and then fade. “That doesn’t happen now. <span class="image">Social media</span> <img src="assets/image/social.gif" class="show"> has changed that; the way an audience interacts with a ‘look’ takes place so quickly.”</p>

  <p>But still, to paraphrase a line from The Big Lebowski, “The illustrator abides.” And we’re all the better for that. Most of the influential <span class="image">art movements</span> <img src="assets/image/source.gif" class="show"> we’ll look at here developed as reactions to the status quo. So let’s find out what those rebels were up to.</p>

        <h4><span class="image">SURREALISM</span> <img src="assets/image/s.png" class="show"></h4>
        <img src="assets/image/evil.gif" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

        The Interpretation of Dreams, published in 1899 by Sigmund Freud, explored the relationship between dreams and reality and laid the foundation for the literary, intellectual, and artistic movement called Surrealism. The French writer, poet, and anti-Fascist André Breton, generally considered the founder of Surrealism, published the Surrealist Manifesto in 1924; it it, he defined surrealism as “pure psychic automatism.”
        While the impact of Surrealist poets and writers was limited; the artists and painters associated with Surrealism had a significant impact on the visual arts and film. In their art, Surrealists liked to place objects not usually related to one another together, in ways that were playful and disturbing. Nature and people might be carefully presented in a true-to-life style but placed in a dreamlike landscape.
        Surrealism’s impact on illustration, design, and visual communication has been distinct and wide-ranging. The movement pioneered new illustration techniques and showed how the world of dreams, symbols, and fantasy could be explored visually in ways that can provoke a universal response across many viewers.



        <h4><span class="image"> MODERNISM</span> <img src="assets/image/m.png" class="show"></h4>
        <img src="assets/image/hero.jpg" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
        <p>Modernist art and the Modernism movement had a significant and far-reaching impact on illustration and design. Starting in around 1908 and lasting through the 1930s, Modernism included a series of distinct movements, including Constructivism, Surrealism, and the Bauhaus. These movements shared a rejection of historical styles, a minimalist design approach, and an original and experimental use of shapes, colors, lines, and layout.</p>
<p>“Constructivism, Bauhaus, and other formal, rigid, minimalist approaches to design and picture-making have lasted in various forms and can be seen in today’s illustrations,” says Richard Lovell, illustration chair at SCAD. “It’s a shape-driven aesthetic that plays well with digital media, and even motion media and animation.”</p>


        <h4><span class="image">CONSTRUCTIVISM</span> <img src="assets/image/c.png" class="show"></h4>
          <img src="assets/image/IMAGE4.png" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
        <p>With roots in the Russian avant-garde, the Constructivist movement originated just before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Influenced by the abstract style, pure form, and energy of Cubism, Futurism, and Suprematism, Constructivist artists aimed to create a new visual language to free art, design, and architecture from conventional forms of representation. Constructivist artists created both political posters and commercial advertising, forever linking the style to political activism.

        Strong geometry, flat color, simple shapes, extensive white space, and bold sans serif typography are hallmarks of Constructivist design. Photomontage provided a new illustration technique for the new age.</p>

        <h4><span class="image">BAUHAUS</span> <img src="assets/image/b3.png" class="show"> </h4>
        <img src="assets/image/Bauhaus.jpg" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
        <p>In 1919, the architect Walter Gropius was made director of Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, combining two art schools into a single institution, and fine and applied arts into one curriculum. A Modernist approach to design education was developed; students were encouraged to experiment and find a design voice of their own.</p>
        <p>The Bauhaus’s powerhouse faculty included the painters Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, Constructivist László Moholy-Nagy, first-student-then-teacher Herbert Bayer, and architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The school explored advanced ideas about architecture, color, and form, and experimented with printing, photography, and typography.</p>



          <h4><span class="image">MAGIC REALISM</span><img src="assets/image/r.png" class="show"> </h4>
        <img src="assets/image/magic.jpg" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
          <p>Magic Realism found traction in the 1940s and ’50s in the Americas. Painting in a detailed, realistic style, the movement’s artists imbued their work with symbolism and a dreamlike, mysterious quality.</p>
        <p>For today’s artists and illustrators, Magic Realism provides a unique approach to storytelling: with its roots in the real world, in realism, “magical” elements can intensify the viewer’s experience of the image or idea in unexpected ways.

        </p>



        <h4><span class="image">ART DECO </span><img src="assets/image/a.png" class="show"> </h4>
        <img src="assets/image/art deco.gif" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<p>The term Art Deco refers to the famous Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts), a large fair held in central Paris during the summer of 1925. Also called Style Moderne, the movement included art, architecture, and the visual and decorative arts: essentially everything that is included under the umbrella of design as we know it today.</p>
        <p>In the visual arts, Art Deco’s distinctive graphic style was represented by simple, clean shapes, and often, in its later period, aerodynamic curves. Contemporary illustrators and designers have explored and reinvented the shapes and typography of the era to create stunning, vital designs.</p>




        <h4> <span class="image">DIGITAL</span> <img src="assets/image/d.png" class="show"></h4>
        <img src="assets/image/digital.png" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
        <p>A new breed of illustrator began to emerge in the mid-1990s. Some were fresh out of art and design schools, with new ways of looking at the traditional roles of designer and illustrator. They reimagined themselves as graphic artists, working across design and illustration. Others were established artists eager to experiment with the new tools and capitalize on new technology. These artists created work on the computer and were proud of it, and a new digital aesthetic emerged.

        </p>
        <p>By the end of the decade, the world had changed in ways no one could have imagined. The computer and software had become fast and sophisticated, with new tools that enabled the look of “natural media”: the pens, pencils, and brushes of traditional illustration. New filters and techniques provided exciting new ways to manipulate imagery. Illustrators could choose to work traditionally or digitally, or to mix the two  as needed. Whitney Sherman characterizes this as a “transmedia/hybrid approach that combines both traditional and digital aesthetics and ways of working.”</p>

          <h4><span class="image">POLITICAL</span> <img src="assets/image/e.png" class="show"></h4>
            <img src="assets/image/political.jpg" class="cut" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
          <p>A political illustration is a picture that makes a point. It delivers a message. It might take a punch at a politician, reveal incompetence, or uncover deception. Political illustration uses caricature, humor, satire, and metaphor to produce true visual journalism that succinctly sums up complex political situations and challenges commonly held beliefs.</p>
<p>ccessing a rich history going back centuries, contemporary artists create political illustration work across a wide variety of artistic techniques, from simple pen and ink to finely crafted painterly styles.</p>
<p>Steve Brodner is an illustrator, graphic artist, and political commentator based in New York—he is one of the most influential and widely read political illustrators working today. His work can be seen in magazines, websites, books, TV, and newspapers—illustrating journalism by himself and others. He has won many awards and continues to push political, artistic, and technical boundaries in his work. Brodner also teaches illustration at the School of Visual Arts in New York.

<p>The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools
  rather than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray —
  or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues. </p>

  <h5> <a href="collage.html"> Cut & Paste Culture</a> </h5>
  <p>Collage has become a representative for that state of cultural production.
    The culture that we live in has become such a sort of cut-and-paste culture. </p>

    <h5> <a href="illustration.html"> Illustration Style</a></h5>
    <p>Illustration is one of the most important forms of visual communication:
       it informs and observes, delights and decorates, instructs and inspires.</p>

       <h5>Conclusion</h5>
       <p>In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations,
         proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, Content
          Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers it becomes
          an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental
          web art and writing projects.</p>
          <p>Collage technique and tradition are naturally suited to commenting on politics or culture because the genre is formally connected to “disparity, upheaval of rupture,” says Zoubok. In that sense, Martha Rosler’s iconic 1960s- and ’70s-era photomontages of housewives vacuuming while American troops invade Vietnam immediately come to mind. As do Mutu’s collaged heroines, their flesh often composed of pornographic, ethnographic, and hip hop–centric portrayals of black women. “It’s the language of that—the language of rupture,” Zoubok adds. “And it is a kind of inherently poetic medium.”</p>

<p> Collage has long been associated with humor too. Urs Fischer’s “Problem Paintings” are screenprints on aluminum wherein knobby root vegetables and crinkled cigarette butts are plastered disruptively atop vintage Hollywood head shots. And John Stezaker, an influential figure in postmodern British art, succinctly cuts and splices film stills .</p>

<p>Collage can say it all.</p>

    Hi, I’m Ivy Wang – a recent MADA graduate from Monash university.
    With the love of design, my focus on the craft
    of design and the creative approach give my works more exploring
    of printed matter, visual identi- ties, editorial design and design art directions.
    I did a lot poster designs, identity designs, publication designs.
      I am also quite enthusiastic about illustration and collage,
